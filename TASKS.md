## Tasks To Complete

+ [x] 0\. README, AUTHORS <br/>_**[README.md](README.md)**_ contains a description of the project and the command interpreter (including how to start it, use it and examples). <br/>_**[AUTHORS](AUTHORS)**_ contains a listing of individuals that have contributed content to the repository.
+ [x] 1\. Be PEP8 compliant! <br/>All the Python files should pass **PEP8** checks and the Bash scripts should pass the **Shellcheck** checks.
+ [ ] 2\. Unittests <br/>_**[tests/](tests/)**_ contains unit tests for all the classes and methods which work in both the interactive and the non-interactive modes.
+ [x] 3\. BaseModel <br/>_**[models/base_model.py](models/base_model.py)**_ contains a class `BaseModel` that defines all common attributes/methods for other classes:
  + Public instance attribute `id` (str) that is assigned with an `uuid` when an instance is created.
  + Public instance attribute `created_at` (datetime) that is assigned with the current datetime when an instance is created.
  + Public instance attribute `updated_at` (datetime) that is assigned with the current datetime when an instance is created and will be updated every time it is changed.
  + `__str__` should return `[<class name>] (<self.id>) <self.__dict__>`.
  + Public instance method `save(self)` that updates the public instance attribute `updated_at` with the current datetime.
  + Public instance method `to_dict(self)` that updates the public instance attribute `updated_at` with the current datetime.
    + A key `__class__` must be added to this dictionary with the class name of the object.
    + `created_at` and `updated_at` must be converted to string object in ISO format. Format: `%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%f` (ex: `2017-06-14T22:31:03.285259`).
+ [x] 4\. Create BaseModel from dictionary <br/>_**[models/base_model.py](models/base_model.py)**_ contains the following updates to its `BaseModel` class:
  + Contains the constructor `__init__(self, *args, **kwargs)` but `*args` won’t be used.
  + If `kwargs` is not empty:
    + Each key of this dictionary is an attribute name except `__class__`.
    + Each value of this dictionary is the value of this attribute name.
    + **NOTE**: `created_at` and `updated_at` are strings in this dictionary, but the `BaseModel` instance works with a datetime object. Thus these strings have to be converted into datetime objects from the string format `%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%f`.
  + Otherwise, `id` and `created_at` are created as they were previously done.
+ [x] 5\. Store first object
  + _**[models/engine/file_storage.py](models/engine/file_storage.py)**_ contains a class `FileStorage` that serializes instances to a JSON file and deserializes a JSON file to instances:
    + `FileStorage` contains the private class attributes:
      + `__file_path`: a string containing the path to the JSON file.
      + `__objects`: a dictionary that stores all objects by `<class name>.id` (e.g.; to store a `BaseModel` object with `id=12121212`, the key will be `BaseModel.12121212`).
    + `FileStorage` contains the public instance methods:
      + `all(self)`: returns the dictionary `__objects`.
      + `new(self, obj)`: sets in `__objects` the `obj` with key `<obj class name>.id`.
      + `save(self)`: serializes `__objects` to the JSON file (path: `__file_path`).
      + `reload(self)`: deserializes the JSON file to `__objects` only if the JSON file (`__file_path`) exists, otherwise nothing (including raising exceptions) is done.
  + _**[models/__init__.py](models/__init__.py)**_ contains a module that creates a unique `FileStorage` instance for the application by creating the variable `storage`, an instance of `FileStorage` and calling the `reload()` method on this variable.
  + _**[models/base_model.py](models/base_model.py)**_ contains the following updates:
    + Imports the `storage` variable from [models/__init__.py](models/__init__.py).
    + Calls the `save(self)` method of the `storage` variable in the method `save(self)` of the `BaseModel` class.
    + In the `__init__(self, *args, **kwargs)` method of the `BaseModel` class, a call to the method `new(self)` is made on the `storage` variable if it’s (the `BaseModel`) a new instance (not from a dictionary representation).
+ [x] 6\. Console 0.0.1 <br/>_**[console.py](console.py)**_ contains a program that contains the entry point of the command interpreter:
  + The `cmd` module must be used.
  + The class definition must be: `class HBNBCommand(cmd.Cmd):`.
  + The command interpreter should implement:
    + `quit` and `EOF` to exit the program.
    + `help` (this action is provided by default by `cmd` but it should be kept updated and documented as the tasks are worked on).
    + A custom prompt: `(hbnb)`.
    + An empty line + `ENTER` shouldn’t execute anything.
  + The code should not be executed when imported.
+ [x] 7\. Console 0.1 <br/>The command interpreter (_**[console.py](console.py)**_) should have these commands:
  + **create**: Creates a new instance of `BaseModel`, saves it (to the JSON file) and prints the `id`. <br/>_Usage_: `create <class name>`.
    + If the class name is missing, print `** class name missing **`.
    + If the class name doesn’t exist, print `** class doesn't exist **`.
  + **show**: Prints the string representation of an instance based on the class name and `id`. <br/>_Usage_: `show <class name> <id>`.
    + If the class name is missing, print `** class name missing **`.
    + If the class name doesn’t exist, print `** class doesn't exist **`.
    + If the id is missing, print `** instance id missing **`.
    + If the instance of the class name doesn’t exist for the `id`, print `** no instance found **`.
  + **destroy**: Deletes an instance based on the class name and id (save the change into the JSON file). <br/>_Usage_: `destroy <class name> <id>`.
    + If the class name is missing, print `** class name missing **`.
    + If the class name doesn’t exist, print `** class doesn't exist **`.
    + If the id is missing, print `** instance id missing **`.
    + If the instance of the class name doesn’t exist for the `id`, print `** no instance found **`.
  + **all**: Prints all string representation of all instances based or not on the class name. <br/>_Usage_: `all [<class name>]`.
    + The printed result must be a list of strings.
    + If the class name doesn’t exist, print `** class doesn't exist **`.
  + **update**: Updates an instance based on the class name and `id` by adding or updating attribute (save the change into the JSON file). <br/>_Usage_: `update <class name> <id> <attribute name> "<attribute value>"`.
    + Only one attribute can be updated at a time.
    + It can be assumed that the attribute name is valid.
    + The attribute value must be casted to the attribute type.
    + If the class name is missing, print `** class name missing **`.
    + If the class name doesn’t exist, print `** class doesn't exist **`.
    + If the id is missing, print `** instance id missing **`.
    + If the instance of the class name doesn’t exist for the `id`, print `** no instance found **`.
    + If the attribute name is missing, print `** attribute name missing **`.
    + If the value for the attribute name doesn’t exist, print `** value missing **`.
    + All other arguments should not be used.
    + `id`, `created_at` and `updated_at` cant’ be updated. It can be assumed that they won’t be passed in the `update` command.
    + Only “simple” arguments can be updated: string, integer, and float. You can assume that nobody will try to update list of ids, dictionary or datetime.
  + Some rules for the command interpreter:
    + It can be assumed that arguments are always in the right order.
    + Each arguments are separated by a space.
    + A string argument with a space must be between double quote.
    + The error management starts from the first argument to the last one.

+ [x] 10\. Console 1.0 <br/>The `FileStorage` managed by _**[models/engile/file_storage.py](models/engile/file_storage.py)**_ correctly serializes and deserializes all the new classes: `Place`, `State`, `City`, `Amenity`, and `Review`. <br/>The command interpreter (_**[console.py](console.py)**_) should be able to allow the `show`, `create`, `destroy`, `update`, and `all` actions with all the classes created previously.
